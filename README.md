# Flutter-Dart-Code

> A collection snippets, syntax support, and hot reload/restart functionality for Dart and Flutter code

Started as a fork of [elMuso/Dartlight](https://github.com/elMuso/Dartlight) but has grown into a more complete Dart and Flutter package.

### Features

*How is this different from [elMuso/Dartlight](https://github.com/elMuso/Dartlight)?*

- Uses native Sublime syntax highlighting, not Textmate bundle conversion
- Includes support for **Hot Reload** and **Hot Restart** on file save
- Better highlighting, overall
- More completions with better defaults
- Fold and indentation rules

### Installation

*With Git*

- `cd $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text/Packages`
- `git clone https://github.com/james2doyle/Flutter-Dart-Code`

*With Package Control*

- "Package Control > Add Repository"
- https://github.com/james2doyle/Flutter-Dart-Code
- "Package Control > Install Package"
- Install "sublime-twig" package

### TODOs

- [x] hot restart/reload
- [x] syntax
- [x] comments
- [x] folding
- [x] indents
- [x] dart 3.0 support (sealed, multiple returns)
- [ ] improve logic for detecting running Flutter server
